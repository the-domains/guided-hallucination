    description: 'In 1982, as new wave and queer punk were invading the Toronto music scene, a computer programmer and artist named Bill Perry brought a desk-sized computer to an artist-run video production centre called Trinity Square Video.

    description: "The Mattress Factory hasn't been an actual mattress factory for a while now. Built on a hillside in the Central Northside neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pa., back at the turn of the last century, it was used as a warehouse and showroom for Stearns & Foster until the 1960s."
