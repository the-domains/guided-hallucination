    description: "Facebook and Google are building enormous neural networks-artificial brains-that can instantly recognize faces, cars, buildings, and other objects in digital photos. But that's not all these brains can do. They can recognize the spoken word, translate from one language to another, target ads, or teach a robot to screw a cap onto a bottle."

    description: 'Two weeks ago we blogged about a visualization tool designed to help us understand how neural networks work and what each layer has learned. In addition to gaining some insight on how these networks carry out classification tasks, we found that this process also generated some beautiful art.'

    description: 'A small group of Google software engineers have open sourced a new tool that can take an image and create an artistic spin on it using deep neural networks. The sample code, which comes in an IPython Notebook, is based on Caffe, which is a deep learning framework developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center.'

description: "Written by Sophie Weiner Recently, a mysterious photo appeared on Reddit showing a monstrous mutant: an iridescent, multi-headed, slug-like creature covered with melting animal faces. Soon, the image's true origins surfaced, in the form of a blog post by a Google research team. It turned out the otherworldly picture was, in fact, inhuman."
