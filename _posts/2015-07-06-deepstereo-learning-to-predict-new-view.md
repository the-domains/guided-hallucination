description: "DeepStereo: Learning to Predict New Views from the World's ImageryComputer vision research from Google uses deep network learning to convert series of images into smooth movement - think of it as possibly turning a collection of Street View images together to make a video (but not a hyperlapse):Deep networks have recently enjoyed enormous success when applied to recognition and classification problems in computer vision, but their use in graphics problems has been limited."
