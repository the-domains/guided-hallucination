    description: "We haven't designed fully sentient artificial intelligence just yet, but we're steadily teaching computers how to see, read, and understand our world. Last month, Google engineers showed off their \"Deep Dream,\" software capable of taking an image and ascertaining what was in it by turning it into a nightmare fusion of flesh and tentacles."

description: "In \" Puppyslugs 'R Us: Part 0 \", I started out quite cheekily on a topic I hope to explore here in a bit more serious detail. Intro I am going to start with the recent Google \"DeepDream\" release and the so-called Puppyslug images you've likely encountered, explaining roughly what those are and how they come to be."
